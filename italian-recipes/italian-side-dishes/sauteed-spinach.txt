2 tablespoons olive oil
4 garlic cloves, peeled and smashed
3 to 4 bunches (2 1/2 pounds total) flat-leaf spinach, trimmed and cleaned, with some water still clinging
1 to 2 tablespoons fresh lemon juice
Coarse salt and ground pepper

In a large skillet, heat oil over medium. Add garlic; cook, stirring, until fragrant and beginning to brown, about 1 minute. Using a slotted spoon, remove garlic and discard.
Raise heat to high. Add spinach to skillet gradually, waiting for one batch to wilt before adding the next. Cook, tossing, until tender, 3 to 4 minutes.
Drain liquid from skillet; add lemon juice, salt, and pepper to taste.
