2 pounds baby carrots (or sliced carrots if baby carrots are not available)
4-5 large garlic cloves, peeled and left whole
1 ½ teaspoons kosher salt
1 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper
½ cup extra virgin olive oil
2 whole lemons, each sliced into four thick slices
1/3 cup balsamic vinegar

Preheat oven to 400 degrees F.
In a large bowl, toss carrots with the garlic, salt, pepper and oil. Pour out onto a sheet pan or roasting pan, lay lemon slices over carrots and place in preheated oven.
Roast for 20 minutes, flip, turn pan and roast for 20 more or until tender.
Place pan over two burners and turn heat to medium high.
Add vinegar and scrape up pan bottom. Once vinegar evaporates, maybe 4-5 minutes, remove from heat and pour into a serving dish and enjoy.
