3 bulbs fennel, scrubbed, cleaned
6 cups chicken stock
salt and pepper, to taste
extra virgin olive oil
1⁄4 cup grated Parmigiano-Reggiano

Preheat the oven to 350°F.
Fully wash and trim the fennel bulbs.
Trim off the tops of the fennel and set aside. Leave enough of the base in tact so the fennel retains its form.
Cut the bulbs lengthwise (top to bottom) into pieces approximately 1” thick.
In a pan, parboil the fennel in chicken stock until slightly tender. Strain and retain the stock.
Place the braised fennel into a pan or cast iron dish that is lightly coated with extra virgin olive oil.
Pour about 1⁄2 cup of the chicken stock over the fennel, salt, pepper, and cover with 1⁄4 cup of Parmigiano-Reggiano.
Finely chop some of the fennel tops and sprinkle over the dish for added fennel flavor.
Place in the oven and cook until the top is golden brown, approximately 20–30 minutes.
Garnish.
