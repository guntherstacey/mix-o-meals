2 Artichokes
4 Cloves Garlic
2 Tbsp Olive Oil
Salt
Pepper
4 Tbsp Butter
3-4 Sprigs Rosemary
1 Lemon

Preheat oven to 375.

Halve artichokes and scoop out the choke. Brush with lemon to prevent browning and place artichokes cut side up in oven safe baking dish. 

Drizzle olive oil over artichokes. Season with salt and pepper. Slice garlic and lemon, put on top of the artichokes. Place rosemary in pan (reserve 1 sprig), then cover baking dish in foil. 

Bake for 30 minutes or until artichoke has softened.

Melt butter and stir in several rosemary leaves. Dip artichoke into the butter, then enjoy!
