2 cups all purpose flour
1/2 teaspoon baking powder
1/4 teaspoon salt
8 ounces unsalted butter, softened
2/3 cup granulated sugar
1 teaspoon vanilla extract
2 egg yolks, room temperature
3 tablespoons whole milk
candied cherries for garnish

Preheat your oven to 350 degrees.
Line a baking sheet with parchment paper
In a mixing bowl whisk together the flour, baking powder and salt. Set aside.
Combine the butter, sugar and vanilla in another mixing bowl and beat with an electric mixer on medium speed until smooth and fluffy.
Beat in each of the egg yolks one at a time until fully incorporated.
Add in the dry ingredients and beat until a stiff dough forms. Add in the milk until fully absorbed. Do not over mix.
Transfer the dough to a pastry bag fitted with a large star tip. Pipe out swirls onto the baking sheet about 1 1/2 inches apart. I made about 6 per sheet. Add a candied cherry to the center of each swirl.
Bake for 12-14 minutes or until the edges are golden brown. Cool completely before serving.
