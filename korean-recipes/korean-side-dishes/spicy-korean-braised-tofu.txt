1 package of tofu (18 ounces: 510 grams)
3 tablespoons cooking oil
1 teaspoon sesame oil
1 teaspoon sesame seeds
1 clove garlic, minced
½ cup minced onion
2 green onions, chopped

For the sauce, mix in a small bowl:

1 tablespoon soy sauce
1 teaspoon salt
1 teaspoon sugar
1 tablespoon hot pepper flakes

½ cup waterRinse tofu in cold running water and dry it with cotton or paper towel. Cut it into ¼ inch thick bite size pieces.
Add the cooking oil to a non-stick pan and heat it up over high heat.
Gently set the tofu onto the pan and cook for 7 to 8 minutes. Rotate the pan to cook the tofu evenly. When the bottoms get a little crunchy, flip them over one by one with a spatula. Let cook another 7 to 8 minutes until both sides of each tofu piece are a little crispy and golden brown.
Transfer the tofu to a plate. Keep the leftover oil.
Heat up a small pan over medium high heat and add the leftover oil.
Add chopped onion, garlic, and green onion (less 1 tablespoon, to be used for a garnish later). Stir with a wooden spoon for a few minutes until the onion gets a little crispy.
Add the sauce and keep stirring until it reduces a bit and thickens.
Add tofu and braise for a minute until the tofu absorbs some of the flavor of the sauce. 
Add some sesame oil and stir.
Sprinkle some sesame seeds over top and the rest of the chopped green onion. Serve right away with rice.
