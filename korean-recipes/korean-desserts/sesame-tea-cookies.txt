1 1⁄3 cups flour
1 teaspoon ground cardamom
1⁄4 teaspoon salt
1⁄2 teaspoon baking powder
1⁄2 cup margarine (1 stick) or 1⁄2 cup butter (1 stick)
1⁄4 cup white sugar
1⁄4 cup brown sugar
1⁄2 cup tahini
1 teaspoon vanilla extract
2 tablespoons sesame seeds
1 teaspoon fresh ginger (optional)

Combine flour, cardamom, salt, and baking powder. Set aside.
Mix the sugars and butter ( or margarine) over medium speed until fluffy.
Mix in the tahini (make sure to mix well), then the vanilla, sesame seeds, and ginger (if using).
Over low speed, add flour mixture. Dough should be a bit crumbly (much like shortbread dough).
Cover dough with plastic wrap and chill for about an hour.
Preheat oven to 350.
Shape dough into small balls (about 1 inch or 15 grams).
Arrange onto a baking sheet (I use baking mats, but parchment also works).
Using a glass, press the cookies down into discs. You may need to dip the glass in water to prevent the cookies from sticking to the glass.
Bake about 8 minutes until the edges are slightly browned.
Cool for a few minutes on the baking sheet before transferring to a wire rack.
