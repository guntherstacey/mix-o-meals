3~4 slices of bread , strawberries , butter , honey , chocolate syrup , cinnamon powder, whipped cream & ice cream  
If you don't like strawberries ; add banana , peach , tangerine & etc !

I used whole bread , but it doesn't matter if you use slices. 
 Run through knife just like shown in picture 

I went almost to the bottom so butter and honey will soak in deeply.


Melt the 1 table spoon of butter and 1 table spoon of honey in the 
microwave for 30 sec. 

Then brush all over the top and let it soak in.


Bake it for 15 minutes on 300 degrees 
( Until nice golden brown ) 


decorate with you favorite toppings .. 
and  your done !!!
