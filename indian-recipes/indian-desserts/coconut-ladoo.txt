Desiccated Coconut - 1 1/3 Cups (extra for coating)
Milk - 3/4 Cup
Sugar - 1/3 Cup
Ghee - 2 tsp
Cardamom powder - 1/8 tsp

First take a large pan and saute the coconut until it is slightly warm to touch. This basically removes excess moisture from the coconut. But take care to not change the color of the coconut.

Now add the milk and sugar and mix well. Stir at regular intervals and Continue to cook in medium low flame until the mixture becomes dry.

Now add the ghee and give a quick mix. Add the cardamom powder and mix well. Cook until the mixture turns slightly sticky starts to bind with itself.

Turn off the flame and let it cool down until it is cold enough to touch. Grease your palm with more ghee and roll out the coconut mixture into balls. Roll the coconut ladoos into some more desiccated coconut. Leave it to cool completely to room temperature.

Enjoy.
