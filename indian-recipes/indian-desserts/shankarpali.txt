maida
Plain flour - 1 cup, (maida)
Ghee - 2 1/2 tbsp, OR oil
Salt - a pinch
Cardamom powder - 1/4 tsp (elaichi powder)
Sugar - 1/4 cup
Water - 1/4 cup
Oil for deep frying

In a bowl, add the maida, salt, and cardamom powder and mix well.
In a small pan, add water, ghee and sugar and allow the sugar to melt. Turn off heat and pour this over the flour mixture.
Slowly, keep mixing to form a slightly firm yet smooth dough. Knead for a good 6-8 minutes. Cover and set aside for at least 30 to 60 minutes.
Dust the working surface with flour, Divide the kneaded dough into two portions.
Roll the dough into a large thick circle. You can roll it into a 1/4" thick circle. You can even roll it a little thinner than 1/4".
Use a sharp knife or a pizza cutter to cut into 1/2" width long horizontal strips. Cut these strips vertically so that you achieve diamond cuts.
Remove each cut piece and place on a plate so that you can drop them easily into the hot oil while deep frying.
Heat oil for deep frying in a heavy bottomed vessel. Place a small piece of dough in the hot oil and if it sizzles and comes to the surface of the oil, it is ready for deep frying.
Reduce flame to medium, place few of the cut pieces carefully into the hot oil without overcrowding the vessel. (Fry in batches)
Deep fry till they attain a golden brown shade. You will know they are done once the sizzling of oil stops and the biscuits attain a golden shade.
Remove the finished shakarpara with the help of a slotted ladle and place on an absorbent paper. Once cool, place them in an airtight container.
