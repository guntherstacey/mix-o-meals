2 1/2 tbsp unsalted butter
1 tsp salt
1/4 tsp turmeric
1 1/2 cups rice
3 cups water
3 tbsp fresh lemon juice

In a saucepan over medium-high heat melt the butter. 

Stir in the turmeric, salt and rice. Cook for about 2 minutes, stirring constantly, to toast the rice a bit.

Add the water and lemon juice and bring to a boil. Reduce heat to low and cover the pan.

Allow the rice to cook over low heat until the water is absorbed, about 20 minutes.
