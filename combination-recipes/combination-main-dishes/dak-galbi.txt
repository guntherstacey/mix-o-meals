1 pound of deboned drumsticks (the video shows how to debone them), or chicken breast
3 tablespoons of soy sauce
10 cloves of peeled garlic, minced
1 tablespoon minced ginger
¼ cup hot pepper paste (gochujang)
⅓ cup hot pepper flakes (gochugaru)
½ cup cooking wine (mirim) or water-sugar solution (½ cup water and 1 teaspoon sugar)
½ teaspoon ground black pepper
1 pound cabbage, rinsed, cut into bite sized pieces
1 medium onion (about 1 cup), sliced
5 oz (1cup) rice cake (garaeddeok), cut into 2 inch long pieces
5 oz (1 cup) sweet potato, peeled and sliced into bite sized pieces
1 small carrot (½ cup), sliced
2 green chili peppers, sliced
2 dozen perilla leaves

Cut the chicken into bite size pieces and put them into a bowl. Mix with 1 tablespoon soy sauce and  ground black pepper by hand or a spoon. Set aside.dakgalbi
Prepare the sauce by combining garlic, ginger, hot pepper paste, hot pepper flakes, 2 tablespoons of soy sauce, and cooking wine in a bowl. Mix it well with a spoon. If you  use a food processor, blend it until creamy for about 1 minute.dakgalbi_sauce
Prepare a large, shallow, and wide pan or a grill for the dakgalbi. Spread the cabbage on the bottom of the pan. Add the onion, green chili pepper, carrot, rice cake, and sweet potato.
Add the perilla leaves on top. You can cut them a few times or place the leaves whole. The leaves will shrink when cooked, so don’t be afraid to be generous!
Put the marinated chicken in the center of the pan, on top of the vegetables. Put the sauce on top.dakgalbi_seasonings
Cover and cook over medium high heat for 2 to 3 minutes. Stir with a wooden spoon so the pan doesn’t burn and the ingredients and sauce mix evenly.dakgalbi
Lower the heat to medium and cover. Cook for another 20 minutes, or until it’s done. Keep stirring with a wooden spoon.dakgalbi
Now you can eat. The cabbage will cook first, followed by the rice cake, chicken, and sweet potato, so eat in that order. Keep the heat low during the meal. Cook, stir, eat, and talk. The pieces will be hot, so be careful! If the dakgalbi becomes totally cooked, turn off the heat.
When it’s almost totally finished, add some rice and chopped kimchi to what’s left on the grill and stir with a wooden spoon over medium heat for a few minutes. Serve in separate bowls, or give everyone a spoon and let them eat from the pan together.
