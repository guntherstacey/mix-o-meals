2 tablespoons oil
12 oz. beef, sliced thinly against the grain and mixed with 1 teaspoon oil and 2 teaspoons cornstarch
5 cloves garlic, chopped
½ of a red bell pepper, sliced thinly
1 small onion, thinly sliced
2 teaspoons soy sauce
1 teaspoon dark soy sauce
1 teaspoon oyster sauce
1 tablespoon fish sauce
½ teaspoon sugar
1 cup Thai basil leaves, packed
Cilantro, to garnish.

Heat your wok over high heat, and add the oil. Sear the beef until just browned, remove from the wok, and set aside.
Add the garlic and red pepper to the wok and stir-fry for about 20 seconds. Add the onions and stir-fry until browned and slightly caramelized.
Toss the beef back in, along with the soy sauce, dark soy sauce, oyster sauce, fish sauce, and sugar. Stir-fry for another few seconds, and then fold in the Thai basil until it’s just wilted. Serve with jasmine rice, and garnish with cilantro.
