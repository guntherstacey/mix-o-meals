Cake: 1 1/2 cups all-purpose flour 
1 cup sugar 
1/2 cup unsweetened cocoa 
2 teaspoons cinnamon 
1 teaspoon baking soda 
1/4 teaspoon cayenne pepper or ground Mexican chili powder 
1/4 teaspoon salt 
1 cup cold water 
1/4 cup canola oil 
1 tablespoon balsamic vinegar 
1 tablespoon vanilla extract 

Chocolate glaze: 
1 cup confectioners' sugar 
1/2 cup cocoa 
6 tablespoons water 
10 small fresh strawberries

Heat oven to 350Â° F. Lightly coat an 8-inch round cake pan with vegetable cooking spray.


Combine all the cake ingredients in a mixing bowl and stir until smooth. Pour into the pan and bake 25 to 30 minutes or until a toothpick inserted in the center comes out clean.


Cool in the pan on a wire rack for 10 minutes. Remove from pan and cool completely.


When the cake has cooled, whisk together the first three glaze ingredients. Dip each strawberry into the glaze and set aside. Pour the remaining glaze over the cake and arrange the strawberries on top. Set aside to dry, about 30 minutes.
