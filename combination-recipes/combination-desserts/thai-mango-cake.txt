For the Cake:
6 large eggs (room-temperature)
1 cup sugar
1 tablespoon coconut (dried, sweetened)
1 cup flour (all-purpose)
2 teaspoons baking powder
1/4 teaspoon salt
2 tablespoons coconut oil (melted or 2 tablespoons melted butter)
1 teaspoon coconut extract (or vanilla extract)

For the Mango and Cream:
2.2 ounces/62 g cream cheese (room-temperature)
1/3 cup sugar
1 teaspoon coconut extract (or vanilla extract)
1 1/2 cups whipping cream
2 ripe diced mangos (about 2 cups or 2 (14-ounce/398-ml) cans sliced mango, drained)

Make the Cake

Heat oven to 325 F. Line two (9-inch) cake pans with parchment paper and set aside. 
In a large bowl, beat eggs and 1 cup sugar on high speed 4 to 5 minutes or until a ribbon forms when you stop and lift beaters from the batter.
On low speed, add coconut, then gradually add flour, baking powder, salt, melted and cooled coconut oil or butter, and 1 teaspoon coconut or vanilla extract. Avoid over-mixing.
Pour batter into prepared pans distributing evenly. Bake 30 to 40 minutes, or until an inserted fork comes out clean.
Run a butter knife around the circumference of each pan to loosen, then leave in pans to cool completely on wire racks.

Make the Mango and Cream

Meanwhile, in a large bowl, beat cream cheese with 1/3 cup sugar and 1 teaspoon coconut or vanilla extract until smooth.
In a medium separate bowl, whip the cream until stiff peaks form (6 to 8 minutes). Fold whipping cream into cream cheese a little at a time.

Assemble the Cake

Gently remove cakes from pans. Place 1 cake on plate and spoon over some of the cream (about 1/2 to 1 inch). Top with 1/2 of the diced mango.
Then gently set the second cake on top and smother with cream. Add cream to cover the sides of the cake.
Decorate with more fresh mango and your choice of other fruitâ€”blueberries, blackberries, red currants, strawberries. Chill until ready to serve.
