4 ripe bananas or plantains
1 cup plus 2 tablespoons rice flour
1/2 cup sugar
1/2 cup grated coconut
2 tablespoons sesame seeds
3/4 cup water
1 1/2 teaspoon baking soda
1 teaspoon salt
Oil for deep frying

Make the batter: sift rice flour, baking soda, sugar, and salt together in a mixing bowl. Then add sesame seeds and grated coconut. Gradually add water while whisking. Stir until fully incorporated.

Heat oil to 350Â°F. Slice bananas lengthwise and set aside.

Place banana slices into the batter, and make sure each slice is thoroughly coated. Fry only a few slices at a time. Occasionally flip them over to ensure even frying. Once golden brown and crispy, drain on paper towels. Best when served immediately.
