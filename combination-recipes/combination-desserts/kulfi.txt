2 cups whole milk
1/2 cup condensed milk
1/4 cup dry milk powder
2 teaspoons white sugar, or to taste (optional)
1/2 teaspoon ground cardamom
1 pinch saffron threads
1/4 cup chopped pistachio nuts

Stir the milk, condensed milk, and dry milk powder together in a heavy-bottomed pan and bring to a boil. Add the sugar, cardamom, and saffron to the boiling milk; reduce heat to low and simmer, stirring frequently, for 10 minutes. Remove from heat and allow to cool to room temperature; fold the pistachio nuts into the mixture.
Pour the mixture into popsicle molds and freeze until solid, about 1 hour
