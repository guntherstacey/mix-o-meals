1/2 large canister of buttermilk biscuits, 6 large biscuits
Peanut or vegetable oil for deep frying
Sweetened condensed milk for drizzling

In a wok or large frying pot, heat a few inches of oil on medium high heat.

Separate one biscuit from another. Further separate them by peeling each one into halves, which will give you 12 biscuits. Cut each separated layer into half moon shapes so you have 24 pieces.

Making sure that the oil is hot enough, (if you place your hand 1 inch above the oil and it feels very hot then it should be ready), gently place half moon biscuits into the oil. Fry on each side until golden brown, taking care to flip each over as soon as one side is golden. If you wait too long to flip it over, it will refuse to flip over, resulting in one burnt side and one raw side. Fry in batches and drain on paper towel.

Arrange on a serving plate and drizzle with sweetened condensed milk. Serve warm.
