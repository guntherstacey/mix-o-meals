2 cups granulated sugar
1 cup water
1/2 cup light corn syrup
1 lb fresh strawberries, stems on

Prepare a baking sheet by lining it with aluminum foil and spraying the foil with nonstick cooking spray.
Wash the strawberries and dry them carefully.
Prepare an ice bath by placing ice and cold water in a bowl large enough to hold your intended saucepan.
Combine the sugar, corn syrup and water in a medium saucepan over medium-high heat. Insert a candy thermometer, and stir until the sugar is completely dissolved.
Continue to cook, without stirring, until the temperature reaches 300 degrees on the candy thermometer. During this process, which can take from 10-20 minutes, wash down the sides of the saucepan occasionally with a wet pastry brush to prevent crystallization.
Once the candy has reached 300 degrees, remove the pan from the heat immediately, and immerse the bottom in the prepared ice bath to stop it from cooking any further. Do not let the ice water get into the candy!
Once the candy has stopped cooking (look for the bubbles to stop rising from the bottom of the pan), you can begin to dip your berries. Holding a strawberry by the stem, dip it until it is almost submerged in the candy. Be careful not to touch the candy, as it is very hot and can cause dangerous burns. Remove the berry from the candy and allow the excess to drip off the end. Turn it a few times to ensure excess candy is removed, then place it on the prepared, oiled baking sheet.
Repeat with remaining berries and candy. Allow the candy to set at room temperature, and serve berries within an hour or two of their preparation.
