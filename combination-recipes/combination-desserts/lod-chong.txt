INGREDIENTS FOR LOD CHONG
500 Grams Rice Flour
250 Grams Mung Bean Flour
12 Cups Pandan Water

INGREDIENTS FOR TOPPING SAUCE
500 Grams Palm Sugar
3/4 Cups Jasmine Water (put about 20 fresh jasmine flowers in water and let it sit over night) for the aroma of jasmine (optional)
300 Grams Sugar
1000 Grams Coconut Cream

Pandan Water: Prepare slaked lime water by mixing two tablespoons lime paste, then squeeze the leaves & strain until you get fragrant, green water.

Pour rice flour in a large wok, followed by mung bean flour and the pandan water mixture. Cook over medium heat.

Start to stir right away. The recommended technique is to stir in one direction only. Continue stirring for 10-15 minutes until the batter starts to set with thick consistency.

Turn off the heat and pour the cooked batter into a Lod Chong press with a bucket below containing water at room temperature to capture the Lod Chong noodles. Press down in a pumping motion so the noodles will be short.
