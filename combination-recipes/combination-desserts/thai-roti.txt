120 ml water 1 tsp salt
250 g wheat cake flour 
1 egg - beaten 
2 Tbs margarine - broken into little pieces 
200 ml flavourless oil (vegetable, sunflower or coconut oil) 
2 bananas 
2 tsp cinnamon powder 
4 tsp caster sugar 
A few spoons condensed milk

Sieve the flour and salt into a large bowl and make a well in the middle.

Add the egg to the flour and mix well until the mixture resembles bread crumbs. 

Gradually add the water and bring the dough together. 

Knead for about 15 minutes until smooth and silky.

Transfer the dough to a bowl smeared with margarine, cover and leave for an hour.

Next, roll the dough in your hands to form and oval shape and cut into 4 equal sized balls.

Place the balls back into the bowl, put a small piece of margarine onto each ball and pour over the oil.

Cover the bowl and leave the Roti’s to rest in a warm place (not too warm to melt the margarine) for 3 hours to overnight.

While the Roti’s are resting; in a separate bowl mix together cinnamon powder and caster sugar to make a cinnamon sugar.

When ready, on a flat surface flatten a ball and thin it out by slapping it on the surface. This technique requires practice so using a rolling pin will do.

When as thin as possible lift the Roti and place into a hot, well oiled skillet / pan (use the oil that the Roti’s were covered in) and cook until bubbles appear on the surface. 

Add your banana slices to the middle of the Roti, fold over the corners to form a square, turn over the Roti and cook until golden brown and crispy on both sides. 

Remove from the pan and sprinkle with cinnamon sugar and some condensed milk. 

Cut into 4x4 squares (16 bite size pieces) and enjoy.
