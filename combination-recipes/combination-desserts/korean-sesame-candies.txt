2 cups sesame seeds (regular or black)
1 cup light brown sugar
3/4 cup water
4 tablespoons honey

In a large skillet, roast sesame seeds over low heat until they start to pop. They should become fragrant after 4 or 5 minutes.
Remove seeds from heat and reserve.
In a medium saucepan, combine brown sugar, water, and honey over low heat.
Stir often until sugar is melted, making sure that the syrup does not burn.
Remove from heat when the syrup is thick (about 5-7 minutes).
Immediately pour sesame seeds into syrup, mixing to combine.
Spread the sesame seed and syrup mixture onto a cookie sheet that is either greased or lined with parchment paper.
Place another piece of parchment paper on top and roll gently with a rolling pin to flatten the top of the candy.
Let candy cool about 5 minutes and then cut with a sharp knife into 1-inch squares or smaller rectangles. (Grease the knife if you are having a hard time cutting through).
Cool completely and enjoy or store in an airtight container.
