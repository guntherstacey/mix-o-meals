1 can(12 fl.oz/354ml) Evaporated milk
1 can(14 oz./397g.) Condensed milk
⅓ cup Key lime juice, fresh
1½ rolls(4.9oz./140g. ea.) Maria cookies

Place condensed milk and evaporated milk in a blender. Turn blender on low setting and add in lime juice gradually, until the mixture thickens and coats the back of a spoon.
Line the bottom of an 8×8 glass baking dish with a layer of cookies and pour some of the milk mixture on top of the cookies; enough to cover them but not drown them.
Repeat this process until all the milk mixture and cookies have been used up.
Place cake in refrigerator over night.
Cut and serve with strawberries on top.
