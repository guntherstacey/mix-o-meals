½ pound fish cakes (fish cakes store-bought or homemade), sliced into thin pieces
1 tablespoon vegetable oil
2 to 3 tablespoons hot pepper paste
1 tablespoon rice syrup, corn syrup, or sugar
2 teaspoons sesame oil
1 teaspoon sesame seeds
½ medium onion (¼ cup), sliced thinly
¼ cup worth carrot, sliced thinly
1 garlic clove, minced
1 green chili pepper, chopped
1 green onion, chopped

Heat up a frying pan over medium high heat. Add 2 teaspoons vegetable oil and the sliced fish cakes. Stir them with a wooden spoon for a few minutes until light golden brown.

Add onion, carrot, garlic, and  green chili pepper, and keep stirring for a few minutes until the onion looks a little translucent.
Turn the heat down to low. Push the fishcakes and vegetables to the edge of the pan with a wooden spoon to clear out a spot in the middle of the pan.
Add 1 teaspoon vegetable oil, hot pepper paste, and rice syrup to the center of the pan. Mix well for a few seconds, and then mix in the fishcakes and the vegetables from the edges of the pan.
Remove it from the heat. Add green onion, sesame oil, and sprinkle some sesame seeds over top.
Serve with rice.
