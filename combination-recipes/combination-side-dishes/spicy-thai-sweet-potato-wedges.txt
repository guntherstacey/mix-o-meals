Spicy Sweet Potato Wedges
1.5 - 2 lbs of mixed sweet potatoes (I used purple and orange), cut into wedges
1 Tbsp. coconut oil
1 large clove of garlic, chopped
sambal oelek, or your favourite savoury chili paste, to taste (see notes)
salt, to taste
Toppings
1 cup of packed shredded purple cabbage
1/4 cup of chopped toasted cashews
torn or roughly chopped mint leaves
thinly sliced chilis
1 lime
Mango Dipping Sauce
1 small shallot, roughly chopped
1 small ripe mango (I like ataulfo mangoes for this), peeled and sliced.
1/2 a cup of coconut milk
juice of one juicy lime
1/2 tsp. turmeric powder
1/4 tsp. salt

Preheat the oven to 400°F.
Melt the coconut oil in a small skillet over low-medium heat.
Add the garlic and sauté for a minute or two until very fragrant.
Add a few tablespoons of the chili paste (see note) and keep sautéing until everything is well incorporated and smells amazing.
Toss the mixture with the sweet potato wedges and season with salt, to taste (amount will depend on how much salt is in your chili paste - I had to add a few pinches with the sambal oelek).
Roast for about 30 minutes, until the potatoes are fully cooked (pierce with a knife to test), starting to brown on the bottom, and there are burnt garlic bits on the surface.
While the potatoes are roasting prep the toppings and make the mango dipping sauce. Combine all the dipping sauce ingredients in a food processor or high speed blender and process until really smooth. Add some more coconut milk and/or water, if needed, to adjust the consistency. It took a couple of minutes at super high speed in my blender. Taste and adjust with salt and/or lime juice. Refrigerate until ready to use.
Massage the shredded cabbage with a pinch of salt and the juice of half a lime. Set aside and slice the remaining half of the lime into wedges.
When the potatoes are ready, top them with the cabbage and remaining toppings right away and serve hot with the lime wedges and mango dipping sauce on the side.
