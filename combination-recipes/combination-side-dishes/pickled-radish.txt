5 Cups Korean Radish (About 1½ lb)
⅓ Cup White Vinegar
⅓ Cup Water
⅓ Cup White Sugar
1 tsp Salt

Peel the Korean radish.
Slice the radish into ½ inch slices.
Cut the radish into ½ inch cubes.
Mix ⅓ cup of white vinegar, ⅓ cup of water, and ⅓ cup of white sugar, and 1 tsp of salt in a mixing bowl until the sugar dissolves. It is important to use white vinegar. Flavored vinegar will change the taste. You can add more sugar or vinegar; however, with my experimentation, a 1:1:1 ratio for the vinegar, water, and sugar tastes the most delicious.
Mix in the radish.
Put it in wide bottomed container and leave it at room temperature overnight. Then place it in the refrigerator for about 2 to 3 days before serving.
