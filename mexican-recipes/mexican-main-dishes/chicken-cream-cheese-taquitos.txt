3 cups cooked shredded chicken
6 ounces ounces cream cheese, softened
⅓ cups sour cream
½ cups salsa
1½ cups colby jack cheese
1½ cups chopped baby spinach, stems removed
12 - 6 inch corn tortillas
vegetable or canola oil, for frying

Heat ½" oil in a sauce pan on medium heat.
In a large bowl mix together the chicken, cream cheese, sour cream, salsa, co-jack and spinach. Add salt and pepper to taste.
Once oil is hot enough (place hand over pan, above oil, to feel heat), add a few tablespoons of chicken/cream cheese mixture to the center of a tortilla and spread out. Roll up and set seam side down in oil using tongs. Cook until golden brown on both sides.
Repeat until all the tortillas are filled, rolled and fried.
Set on paper towels to drain.
Serve warm and ENJOY!
