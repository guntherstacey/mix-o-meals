1 -14.5 ounce can diced tomatoes
1 -10 ounce can diced tomatoes with green chiles
3 cloves garlic
1/2 onion
1 jalapeno deseeded and membranes removed
1/2 tablespoon honey
1/2 cup cilantro
1/4 teaspoon salt
Juice from 1/2 lime

Roughly chop up 1/2 an onion, 1 jalapeno (remove seeds as desired, the seeds will add heat), and 3 cloves of garlic. Add to food processor (affiliate link).
Add in 1 can of diced tomatoes and 1 can of diced tomatoes with green chiles.
Add in honey, salt, 1/2 cup cilantro leaves, and juice of 1/2 lime (start slow with the lime as it can overpower, you can taste and add more if desired)
Blend in food processor for about 30 seconds or until desired consistency.
