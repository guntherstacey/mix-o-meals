1 cup of white sugar
1 cup of brown sugar
1 cup of Fisher Nuts Pecans (whole or pieces)
7 Tablespoons milk
Wax Paper

Cook sugar & milk ingredients in saucepan until you a small ball forms in a glass of water. Meaning, drop just a tiny bit into a glass of water and if it forms into a solid, then it's ready.
Mix in pecans.
Pour spoonfuls out onto waxed paper and let cool.
