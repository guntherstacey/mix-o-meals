1 cup plus 2 tablespoon water, divided
2 tablespoons cornstarch
3 medium cloves of garlic, minced (about 1 tablespoon)
2 tablespoons finely chopped fresh Fresno, red Thai chilies, or red jalape√±o peppers (seeds left in for a hotter sauce)
2/3 cup sugar
1/3 cup rice vinegar
2 teaspoons salt


In a small bowl, whisk together 2 tablespoons water and cornstarch. Set aside.

In a medium saucepan, mix together remaining 1 cup water, garlic, peppers, sugar, vinegar, and salt. Bring to a boil over medium heat, reduce heat and simmer for 3 to 5 minutes.

Stir cornstarch mixture to re-combine, then whisk into simmering sauce and cook until thickened, about 1 minute more. Remove from heat, let cool, and use immediately or store in an airtight container in the refrigerator.
