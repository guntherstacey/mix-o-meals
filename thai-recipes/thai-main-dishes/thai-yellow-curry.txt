4 cloves garlic crushed
2 t. ginger grated

Yellow Chicken Curry
2 T. olive oil

2 15-oz. cans full-fat coconut milk

For the Yellow Curry Paste:

Combine all yellow curry paste ingredients together in the bowl of a small food processor. (If you have a 6+ cup processor you may want to double the recipe.)

Process ingredients for 2-4 minutes, or until ingredients become a thick paste.

For the Yellow Chicken Curry:
Drizzle olive oil into a large pan over medium heat and add onions. Saute for 3-5 minutes.

Add chicken and curry paste. Saute over medium heat for 3-5 more minutes, or until chicken is almost done cooking.

Add carrots, potatoes, milk and sugar. Stir until well combined.

Cover curry and reduce heat to a simmer. Let simmer for 25-35 minutes or until potatoes and carrots are fork tender.

Serve yellow chicken curry over jasmine rice and enjoy!
