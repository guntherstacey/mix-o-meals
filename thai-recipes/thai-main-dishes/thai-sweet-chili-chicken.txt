8 oz skinless, boneless chicken breast/thigh, cut into small pieces
Oil, for deep-frying
1 tablespoon oil
2 cloves garlic, minced
4 tablespoons bottled Thai sweet chili sauce
1 teaspoon lime juice
Pinch of salt
1/2 teaspoon white sesame
1/2 tablespoon chopped cilantro leaves

Frying Batter:
1 egg white
1/2 cup all-purpose flour, sifted
1/4 cup cornstarch
1/2 teaspoon baking powder
1/2 cup water, ice cold
1 tablespoon cooking oil
Pinch of salt

Mix all the ingredients for the Batter until well combine. Add the chicken into the batter.

Heat up a wok/skillet with about two inches of oil. As soon as the oil is fully heated, deep-fry the chicken until golden brown. Transfer the chicken out to a dish lined with paper towels to sock up the excess oil.

Clean the wok/skillet and heat it up on medium heat. Add the oil and stir-fry the garlic until aromatic. Transfer the fried chicken into the wok, follow by the sweet chili sauce, lime juice and salt. Stir to coat the chicken well with the sweet chili sauce.

Dish out, garnish with the white sesame and cilantro leave. Serve immediately.
