1 tbsp vegetable oil
1 tbsp ginger & garlic paste
5-6 tbsp red curry paste
800ml coconut milk
8 skinless, boneless chicken thighs, cut into large chunks
kaffir lime leaves (ideally fresh)
2 tbsp fish sauce
1 tsp brown sugar
½ small pack Thai basil or coriander, plus extra to serve
1 red chilli, sliced diagonally
thumb-sized piece ginger, cut into matchsticks
cooked jasmine rice, to serve

Heat the oil in a large saucepan over a medium heat and fry the ginger and garlic paste for 2 mins. Add the curry paste, sizzle for a few secs, then pour in the coconut milk. Bring to the boil, reduce to a simmer, stir a little and wait for the oil to rise to the surface. Add the chicken and lime leaves, and simmer for 12 mins or until the chicken is cooked through.

Add 1 tbsp of the fish sauce and a pinch of the sugar, then taste – if you like it a little saltier, add more fish sauce; if you like it sweeter, add a little more sugar. Bring to the boil, take off the heat and add the basil.

Spoon the curry into four bowls and top with the chilli, ginger and a few extra basil leaves. Serve with rice.
