For the Salad
1/2 red onion, very thinly sliced
2 large English cucumbers, halved lengthwise, seeded and sliced crosswise 1/4-inch thick
1/3 cup packed chopped fresh cilantro
1/2 cup salted peanuts
1 large jalapeño pepper, seeded and minced (or use 1-2 Thai chiles for more heat)
1/4 teaspoon salt (optional)
For the Dressing
1/4 cup fresh lime juice, from 2-3 limes
2 tablespoons vegetable or canola oil
1-1/2 tablespoons fish sauce
2 tablespoons sugar
1 garlic clove, minced

Place the onions in a small bowl of cold water. Let sit for ten minutes, then drain well and pat dry with a paper towel.
In a large bowl, combine the drained red onions, cucumbers, cilantro, peanuts and jalapeño pepper. Set aside.
Make the dressing: combine the lime juice, oil, fish sauce, sugar and garlic in a small bowl and whisk until the sugar dissolves. Pour the dressing over the salad and toss to combine. Taste and add salt if necessary. Serve the salad within 30 minutes.
