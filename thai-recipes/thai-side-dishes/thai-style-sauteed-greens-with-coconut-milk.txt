1 heaping tablespoon organic coconut oil
2 cloves garlic, minced
1 tablespoon minced ginger
1 tablespoon organic red pepper flakes
1 organic jalapeno, diced
2 large organic scallions, sliced
1 large shallot, diced
3 bunches greens, stems removed and roughly chopped (I recommend rainbow chard, but you could use spinach, collards or any kind of green you prefer)
1/4 cup organic, unsweetened coconut milk
2 tablespoons fish sauce
1 lime, juiced
salt and pepper , to taste

In a large skillet (I recommend Lodge cast iron), heat coconut oil over medium-high heat. Add garlic, ginger, red pepper flakes, jalapeno, scallions and shallot and saute for 3-5 minutes, or until soft and aromatic.
Add the greens, 1-2 cups at a time, and saute until wilted and soft, about 2 minutes per batch.
Stir in the coconut milk and fish sauce, tossing to combine. Garnish with lime juice and salt and pepper, to taste.
Serve and enjoy!
