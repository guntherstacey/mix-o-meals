5 tablespoons fresh lime juice
3 tablespoons (packed) palm sugar or golden brown sugar
2 tablespoons plus 2 teaspoons fish sauce
2 tablespoons dried shrimp, chopped
4 garlic cloves, minced
3 Chinese long beans, halved crosswise or 15 green beans
1 1 1/2- to 13/4-pound green papaya, peeled, halved, seeded
10 large cherry tomatoes, halved
1 cup chopped fresh cilantro
2 green onions, very thinly sliced
1 fresh red Thai chile with seeds, thinly sliced
2 tablespoons coarsely chopped salted peanuts

Whisk first 5 ingredients in medium bowl. Set dressing aside.
Cook beans in medium saucepan of boiling salted water until crisp-tender, about 5 minutes. Rinse under cold water. Cut into 2-inch pieces. Using julienne peeler, peel enough papaya to measure 6 cups. Place in large bowl. Add tomatoes, cilantro, green onions, chile, and green beans. Pour dressing over; toss. Sprinkle peanuts over and serve.
